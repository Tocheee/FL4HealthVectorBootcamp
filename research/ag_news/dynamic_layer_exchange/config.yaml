# Parameters that describe server
n_server_rounds: 6 # The number of rounds to run FL

# Parameters that describe clients
n_clients: 3 # The number of clients in the FL experiment
local_steps: 1000 # The number of steps to complete for client
batch_size: 16 # The batch size for client training

num_classes: 4 # number of classes in the classification task.

normalize: True # specifies whether division by the tensor's dimension is performed when computing its drift norm.
filter_by_percentage: True # this argument toggles between the two mechanisms for selecting the tensors to be exchanged.
select_drift_more: True # If True, then select those tensors that drift the most in l2 norm.

norm_threshold: 24.5 # if a tensor's drift norm exceeds this threshold, then it will be sent to the server. Only applicable when filter_by_percentage is False
exchange_percentage: 0.5 # if a tensor has a drift norm that is falls in the top percentile specified by this argument, then it will be sent to the server. Only applicable when filter_by_percentage is True

sample_percentage: 0.75 # the proportion of the training data that will actually be used in training
beta: 1.0 # controls the heterogeneity of the data distributions among clients
